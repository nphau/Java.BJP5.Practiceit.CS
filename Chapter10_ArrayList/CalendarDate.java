/**
    Suppose that a class CalendarDate has been defined for storing a calendar date with month, day and year components.
    (In our section handout, the class was called Date, but we have renamed it here because Practice-It uses a class named Date for other purposes.) The class includes the following members:

    Name	Description
    private int year	the year component
    private int month	the month component
    private int day	the day component
    public CalendarDate(int year, int month, int day)	constructs a date with given year, month, day
    public int getYear()	returns the year component
    public int getMonth()	returns the month component
    public int getDay()	returns the day component
    public String toString()	returns the date in yyyy/mm/dd format
    Your task is to modify the class to be Comparable by adding an appropriate compareTo method. Dates that occur chronologically 
    earlier should be considered "less" than dates that occur later.

    You may assume that dates are constructed with appropriate values: Months will be between 1 and 12, 
    days will be between 1 and 31 and years will be four-digit numbers. Assume that the toString method produces a standard format 
    with two digits for the month and two digits for the day, including leading zeros if necessary. For example, January 7th, 2005, would return the string "2005/01/07".
